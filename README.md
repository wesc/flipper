Flipper
=======

Flipper is a tutorial I put together while running S7 Labs. The intent was to
bring 3 competent software engineer interns up to speed with web technologies
and concepts. After about 2 weeks of running through the tutorial and building
a simple Twitter clone (along with a federated twist), the interns were then
able to work on production tasks.

This repo contains the Sphinx sources for the tutorial, as well as a little bit
of code embedded in the tutorial.

You can read the tutorial [here](http://wesc.github.io/flipper/flipper.html).
